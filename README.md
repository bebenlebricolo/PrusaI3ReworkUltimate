# PrusaI3ReworkUltimate
Another iteration over the PrusaI3 Rework originally released by eMotionTech. I remodeled the 3D printer with the original frame and redesigned all 3D printed parts with additional ones. The idea is to get rid of the technical flaws while keeping as much of the original hardware as possible.
